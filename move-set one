1. Abyssal Tide

Description: Summons a massive surge of dark, frigid water that crashes into enemies, pulling them into a swirling vortex.

Effect: Deals high water and ice damage, pulling enemies toward the vortex’s center and freezing them in place. Enemies trapped in the vortex have their speed and reaction time reduced.

Combo Potential: If followed up with a void-based attack, the vortex absorbs nearby objects or people, effectively “eating” them and drawing them into the void.

2. Void Cleave

Description: A powerful slash that slices through space itself, leaving a dark rift in its path.

Effect: Deals high void damage, causing a temporary rift that "cuts" through reality. Enemies caught in the rift take damage over time as they’re slowly drawn into the void.

Combo Potential: Can be chained with Frost Shatter (see below) to freeze enemies before the rift consumes them, amplifying the overall damage.

3. Frost Shatter

Description: Encases enemies in ice, then shatters it with a surge of power, sending icy shards flying.

Effect: Freezes enemies on contact, then explodes them outward into shards, dealing damage to other nearby enemies.

Combo Potential: Use after Abyssal Tide to lock enemies in place, or with Void Cleave to cut through the shattered ice shards and amplify the area of effect.

4. Temporal Rip

Description: A quick strike that distorts time around the blade, allowing the wielder to manipulate a brief period of the past.

Effect: Rewinds time in a small area around the blade, restoring the user’s health and position to where it was a few seconds prior. This can also trap enemies in a "time loop," repeating their last few actions.

Combo Potential: After landing a heavy hit, use Temporal Rip to restore position and launch a surprise attack, giving the illusion of teleportation.

5. Starlit Cascade

Description: Summons a rain of icy stars from an open rift, pelting the battlefield with freezing shards.

Effect: Rains down icy meteors over a wide area, dealing ice damage with a void element that drains enemies' energy.

Combo Potential: Follow this move with Abyssal Tide to draw enemies into the storm for sustained damage, or with Frost Shatter to trap them before the cascade finishes.

6. Eternal Freeze

Description: A deadly finishing move that envelops the battlefield in frost, creating an area where time and motion are suspended.

Effect: All enemies in the area are frozen in both space and time, immobilizing them completely and making them highly vulnerable to a follow-up attack.

Combo Potential: This is the perfect setup for a powerful follow-up move, like Void Cleave, or to retreat and heal without threat.

7. Void Surge

Description: Channels void energy into a massive, spiraling surge of dark water that engulfs the enemy.

Effect: Engulfs enemies in a spiraling wave of void-infused water, dealing damage and sapping their life force. The attack can absorb enemies or objects, breaking them down into energy that heals the wielder.

Combo Potential: Use this as a finisher after any other attack, especially Temporal Rip, to heal up and regain energy.

8. Frostbite’s Edge
Description: The ultimate move, where the sword fully manifests its combined powers, slicing open dimensions and freezing time and space.
Effect: The user swings Frostbite in a wide arc, creating a devastating, multi-dimensional slash that freezes enemies, cuts through reality, and shatters the frozen dimensions. Everything within range is either frozen solid or ripped apart by dimensional instability.
Combo Potential: Ideal as a finishing move after Eternal Freeze or Abyssal Tide to trap as many enemies as possible in one final, powerful strike.
